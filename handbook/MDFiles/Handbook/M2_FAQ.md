# The MXC FAQ

**The MXC Community's Most Frequently Asked Questions**

These are the MXC Community's Most *Frequently Asked Questions* (FAQ), taken from chat groups such as [Telegram](https://t.me/mxcfoundation), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/4vrJyhX) and elsewhere. This FAQ (and the MXC Handbook) is a community developed resource. 

##

## How do I mine MXC?
One just needs to purchase the [M2 Pro miner](https://www.matchx.io/product/m2-pro-lpwan-crypto-miner/), download the [DataDash](https://www.mxc.org/mxcdatadash) app (for your [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1509218470) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mxc.smartcity) phone), connect the miner to the Internet, and MXC mining starts immediately.


## How much does the M2 Pro miner earn?
From user reports, the M2 Pro miner earns from $10 - $14 USD worth of MXC per day per miner. The number of MXC tokens mined each day varies, as the price of MXC changes, so that the earnings always stay within this $10 - $14 USD range each day per miner.

[More information](https://mxcfoundation.medium.com/worlds-most-popular-iot-miner-m2-pro-5f3d56d87a16)


## How much does the miner cost?
The M2 Pro miner is 2,500 euros (about $3,000 USD), if purchased from the manufacturer's website [MatchX.io](http://matchx.io). There are also some Promo Codes available, for example using Promo Code: **mxchandbook** will provide a 50 euro discount. The M2 Pro miner is also available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Pro-Crypto-Miner-Blockchain-Multi-Token/dp/B08GQ84HLB/) (currently priced at a bit more).


## Who manufactures the M2 Pro?

[**MatchX**](http://matchx.io) is the manufacturer, based in Berlin, Germany.

[More information at MatchX.io](http://matchx.io)


## How long does it take to get the M2 Pro miner?
At the time of writing, the M2 Pro miner is being shipped from MatchX in about 2-4 weeks (in the European area), and around 6-8 weeks in North America and other parts of the world. MatchX has multiple warehouses around the world, including Europe, North America, Asia and elsewhere, from which M2 Pro miners are shipped.


## Does the M2 Pro use a lot of electricity or internet bandwidth?
No, the M2 Pro uses less than the average household light bulb of electricity per day, and data usage has been reported to be about 500-800 MB per month or less.

[More information](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0565/1323/3091/files/M2_Pro_One-pager-ENG.pdf?v=1619529247)


## Is there a map which shows where all the M2 Pro miners are in the world?
Yes, see [MXCMapper.com](http://mxcmapper.com). Please note that the Blue Dots on this map are the M2 Pro miners, and the Gray Dots are generic [LoRaWAN](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan/) devices which do not do any mining but are an indication of where future earnings might come from. Also please note that the exact locations of these miners and devices are not given on the map, but only a rough estimate, for privacy and security reasons.  The M2 Pros on the map are generally updated manually every week or two.

## Will I earn more if I own more than one M2 Pro miner?
Yes, for MXC mining, you will earn double the MXC if you own two miners, triple if you own three, etc. There is no limit on how many M2 Pro miners you can own and setup, however placement of miners will impact daily earnings in the future (see next questions, and the [**Miner Health**](https://mxchandbook.org/#/MDFiles/Handbook/M2_FAQ?id=What-is-Miner-Health) section below, for more details).


## Can multiple M2 Pro miners be setup right next to each other, without affecting earnings?
At the time of writing, yes. However, in the months ahead, there will be up to a 7% reduction in MXC earnings (per miner) if the miners are less than 50 meters (about 164 feet) from each other. Additionally, there are other factors that miners should be aware of, which can impact earnings now and in the future. Please see the [**Miner Health**](https://mxchandbook.org/#/MDFiles/Handbook/M2_FAQ?id=What-is-Miner-Health) section below. 

[More information](https://blog.mxc.org/miner-health)


## Do I need to have another M2 Pro miner near me in order to earn?
No, you do not need any other M2 Pro miner near you at all. You will continue to earn the daily earnings no matter how remote your miner is or how distant it is from other M2 Pro miners.


## Will I earn more if I live in a city center or industrial area?
No, currently all M2 Pro miners earn the same daily rate of $10-$14, no matter where they are located. However, earnings will likely increase in the future if you are in an area with a lot of industrial/IoT activity, especially as the *Internet of Things (IoT) / crypto data-markets* continue advancing.

[More information](https://medium.com/mxc/tagged/mxc-press-release)


## Does the M2 Pro need to be on a roof, balcony or window?
Currently, no. The M2 Pro can be placed just about anywhere (indoors or outdoors) and it will still continue to earn the daily rate, as long as it has power and is connected to the Internet. **However**, in the future, placement of the miner may impact your daily earnings (both good and bad), so it's a good idea to be thinking about elevating your miner as high as possible, keeping it upright, and ensuring it has a strong GPS signal (and placement on a roof, balcony or a window are good choices). Additionally, when the *Internet of Things (IoT) / crypto data-markets* really start to take off, your earnings could increase dramatically if your miner is able to see/sense other MXC-enabled LoRaWAN/IoT sensors in its environment.

## Is the M2 Pro weatherproof?
Yes, the M2 Pro's housing is [IP-66](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Code) rated, and is capable of operating in [temperatures](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0565/1323/3091/files/M2_Pro_One-pager-ENG.pdf?v=1619529247) from -40ºC (-40ºF) to 85ºC (140ºF). It is designed for use both outdoors and indoors.

[More information](https://matchx.io/pages/m2-pro-miner)


## Can the M2 Pro miner be moved for free?
Yes, there is no cost to move the M2 Pro miner. Additionally, the M2 Pro miner is **mobile**.  Your M2 Pro miner could even mine MXC from your car, if you have an internet connection and power in your car.  You do need to keep your M2 Pro in the same country (or at least in a country which uses the same LoRaWAN frequencies).  And keep in mind that future *Miner Health* factors (such as keeping it upright) might impact earnings down the road (see [Miner Health](https://mxchandbook.org/#/MDFiles/Handbook/M2_FAQ?id=What-is-Miner-Health) section below).


## When I order the M2 Pro miner, do I need to tell MatchX which LoRaWAN frequency to use? How will they know?
MatchX (the manufacturer of the M2 Pro) uses your shipping address to determine which LoRaWAN frequency to use. This is a permanent adjustment in your miner, so make sure that your shipping address is in the country where you will be using the M2 Pro miner. (If you have a question about your order, please contact MatchX at orders@matchx.io and provide your order number in the email).


## Does the M2 Pro miner interfere with any other IoT crypto miners and/or equipment?
No, the M2 Pro does not interfere with other IoT crypto miners (such as Helium), and operates with no impact on other RF (radio frequency) equipment, even if both are in the same room, due to advanced [anti-collision technology](https://www.mxc.org/documents/MXC_technical_whitepaper.pdf) in the M2 Pro.  

From an MXC [article](https://medium.com/mxc/m2-pro-miner-faq-c6b4e8e60ab9) dated 2/2/2021: 

*"The M2 Pro is certified to operate under FCC/CE/RCM/IC/KC and TELEC regulations for radio equipment. Our hardware and software operates safely and within local radio limits, complying with local regulations.*

*The M2 Pro uses LoRa Technology or LPWAN; to find out more about this technology please click [HERE](https://www.whatislpwan.com/). The M2 Pro uses radio frequencies, so your M2 Pro frequency is just as safe as turning on your radio at home."* [(source)](https://medium.com/mxc/m2-pro-miner-faq-c6b4e8e60ab9)


## How long will the $10 - $14 per day per miner earnings last?
The [MXC Foundation's](http://mxc.org) goal is for these earnings (or better) to last as long as possible.

*[More information](https://medium.com/mxc/insider-report-how-to-improve-your-m2-pro-mining-earnings-whats-next-4569fc931ac4)*


## Where does the money/MXC for the daily M2 Pro earnings come from?
It comes largely from early investors and on-going buy-backs from the non-profit [MXC Foundation](http://mxc.org). From an [article](https://medium.com/mxc/m2-pro-miner-faq-c6b4e8e60ab9) by the MXC Foundation dated 2/2/2021: 

*"The MXC Foundation received a large funding round during the MXC ICO process in our inaugural year of 2018. At this time, many of the large investors invested, not only into MXC as a company, but also into our long-term vision for the future of global data. The vision to become a Decentralized Global Data Network payment system was a unique opportunity for many to get involved ...*

*"As a result of this, and in consultation with our range of impressive investors ranging from Huobi, Atlantic Labs, VeChain, LongHash, IOSG Ventures through to JD.com we spoke of a vision of hosting a decentralized network, a network that would spread the globe and allow anyone to join, receive data and monetize the process. ...*

*"As a result of this vision, the mining funds come from two key areas, early investors, who realize the need to sustain a robust new-age global data network, and from the MXC buy-back, which up until 2019 had raised close to $12 million in buy-backs and will continue to raise more buy-back rounds in order to recover $MXC, which the team believes is currently severely under-priced."* [(source)](https://medium.com/mxc/m2-pro-miner-faq-c6b4e8e60ab9)


## What is Miner Health?
***Miner Health*** is the way to keep track of your M2 Pro miner's optimal MXC earning potential, in the DataDash app. Currently, by just keeping your M2 Pro:

- **Powered on**
- **Online** and
- **Accumulating MXC** (i.e. allowing your mined MXC to *accumulate* as *Fuel*) ...

... you will be optimizing your M2 Pro's health and thus your miner's MXC earnings. 

In the future, other Miner Health criteria will be introduced which could impact miner earnings if not optimized, and these will include:

- *Elevation*
- *GPS signal stength*
- *Proximity to other M2 Pro miners (more then 50 meters will be ideal),* and
- *Orientation (i.e. keeping your miner upright).*

[More information](https://blog.mxc.org/miner-health)


## Are the daily earnings impacted if I remove all of my MXC?
Yes, one of the Miner Health criteria is *Fuel*, which is another name for your *mined MXC*. If you remove your mined MXC from Fuel (e.g. moving it to your MXC wallet, staking it, withdrawing it, etc.), this will impact your Miner Health, which will then reduce your MXC earnings by up to 50% if all the mined MXC is removed. Though there is currently a 90-day "grace period" in which your earnings will not be impacted by Health and Fuel after you've first set-up your miner, after the grace period is over, your Health and Fuel at that point will start to impact your earnings. So to keep your earnings maximized on day 91 and later, you will need to get your Health and Fuel as close to 100% as possible which may include returning any removed MXC to the Fuel tank.

[More information](https://blog.mxc.org/miner-health)


## Does the M2 Pro "re-fill the tank" on its own, after all the MXC is removed?

Yes and no. The Fuel **tank** is always the size of ***all the MXC your miner ever mined***. So as the M2 Pro continues to mine MXC tokens, your Fuel **tank** itself is also growing in size. Which means that if you remove 500 MXC tokens from a fuel tank that is 500 MXC in size, your Fuel health will drop from 100% to 0% (which means a 50% drop in earnings). However, as the M2 Pro continues to mine MXC tokens over the next many months, and accumulates (for example) 99,500 more MXC tokens, you will now have a Fuel *tank* that is 100,000 MXC in size, and which is holding 99,500 MXC tokens. And if you've never removed any more MXC tokens, then this will mean your *Fuel* health score will have grown to 99.5% (i.e. 99,500 / 100,000), which would have minimal affect on your daily earnings. But as you can see, you will never return to a true 100% (until you replace the removed MXC) -- but you will get pretty close. 

Also, keep in mind that the amount of mined MXC tokens both grows and shrinks each day (as the price of MXC changes day-to-day), to stay within the $10-$14 range, which effectively makes it impossible to predict how long it will take for any miner to refill itself.

So the general rules of thumb when it comes to MXC and Fuel are: (1) You're free to remove your MXC whenever you want, and (2) Be aware that doing so will impact daily earnings by up to 50%.

## Multi-token mining? What other crypto tokens or coins does the M2 Pro miner mine/earn?
The M2 Pro is a multi-token miner, capable of mining the following:
- [**MXC**](https://mxchandbook.org/#/MDFiles/Handbook/handbook?id=what-is-mxc)
- [**DHX**](MDFiles/Handbook/DHX.md)  (DataHighway tokens, mined from DataDash, with the M2 Pro giving a boost)
- **BTC**     (Bitcoin, currently in [testnet](https://medium.com/mxc/dkp-ii-testnet-critical-analysis-future-insights-390a6fa2183e) phase)
- *DOT      (Polkadot tokens, in planning and development)*


## Does the multi-token mining happen simultaneously?
Yes, the mining of all of these tokens/coins is **simultaneous**.  Your MXC mining stacks on top of your DHX mining which stacks on top of your BTC mining, etc.


## Are there other earnings opportunities with the M2 Pro?
Yes, the MXC Foundation is currently working on other earnings opportunities with the M2 Pro, DataDash and MXC, in addition to multi-token mining and future IoT data-handling income. More information can be found [here](https://medium.com/mxc/mxc-update-dao-substrate-inception-d4e9255edd7) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36DIy3sHaC0).


## What are the differences between the M2 Pro and Helium miners?
About the only thing that is similar between the M2 Pro and a Helium miner, is that they are both crypto IoT/LPWAN devices. But from there, things diverge. Some of the more prominent differences include:
- The M2 Pro miner is truly plug'n'play -- most people have it set up in just a few minutes.
- The M2 Pro miner provides a consistent, dependable income day in and day out. 
- The M2 Pro doesn't need to have any other miners near it, for it to continue mining and earning.
- The M2 Pro continues to make substantial daily earnings, even with other M2 Pros right next to it.
- The Helium miner is built on off-the-shelf raspberry pi technology, where the M2 Pro uses advanced proprietary technology (particularly [Anti-collision](https://www.mxc.org/documents/MXC_technical_whitepaper.pdf) and [Smart-machine Bidding](https://www.mxc.org/documents/MXC_smb_whitepaper.pdf) technologies, whose importance and  benefits will become clearer as IoT/LoRaWAN networks grow).
- The M2 Pro is a multi-token miner, and doesn't just mine it's one native token.
- The M2 Pro miner offers an optional internal 4G modem for remote installations (e.g. for situations where there is no internet service, other than cell phone service).
- The M2 Pro miner is *modular* to protect against becoming obsolete, e.g. a slot for a fourth antenna is available (as just mentioned), and the ability to be powered through a modular solar attachment is also designed in.
- The M2 Pro is designed to last 10 years.
- The M2 Pro Miner has self-diagnostic features including temperature, voltage, current, power, pressure, and 3D orientation monitoring.
- The M2 Pro supports passive PoE 24V and a USB-PD 20V power supply (e.g. for the aformentioned remote/solar use).

### How does the M2 Pro compare to a traditional Bitcoin miner, e.g. the Bitmain "Antminer S19 Pro"?

Here's a table which provides more details:

| Stat | Bitmain S19 Pro | M2 Pro | 
| ---- | --------------- | ------ |
| Cost | €3500 | €2500 |
| Power Consumption | 3250 Watt | 5 Watt |
| Noise | 75 dB | Silent |
| Operating costs (monthly) | ~€600 | Virtually "0" |
| Set Up | Requires Tech Skills | Plug'n'Play |
| Outdoor usage | No | Weatherproof, IP66 |
| Interface | Ethernet | Ethernet/Wi-Fi/'LTE' |


## Do you need IoT data transfer on the M2 Pro to mine MXC?  
No, currently the MXC IoT data-market is not live, so no IoT data transfers are needed to earn/mine MXC. When it goes live, the earnings will be on top of existing earnings. This is in part made possible by the unique protocol which the M2 Pro uses called [**PoP (Proof Of Participation)**](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-13-2324-9_3). This protocol allows sufficient flexibility for the MXC Foundation to roll out MXC mining and other earnings in a manner and timeframe that is needed as the [IoT data-market develops](https://medium.com/mxc/tagged/mxc-press-release). 

The MXC Foundation is also actively working to build-out and support this upcoming billion-dollar [IoT Data Market](https://medium.com/mxc/mxc-focuses-on-billion-dollar-iot-provisioning-sector-7d4a53235f0b).


## How long will the M2 Pro mine for?
From an MXC [article](https://medium.com/mxc/m2-pro-miner-faq-c6b4e8e60ab9) from 2/2/2021:

*The MXC Foundation is committed to creating a vibrant data network. To do this, we must ensure that miners stay active, but how does $MXC ensure that miners stay active? By continuing the PoP process, it is in the interest of $MXC, Miners, and the Data community to keep the M2 Pro miners in operation for as long as possible. Our goal is to have this network fully self-sustainable, but we also realize this will take time, this is a journey we are prepared to walk together, with our miners and community.*

*With regard to the M2 Pro miner and the material and product itself, we expect our award-winning M2 Pro Miner to continue to function as a data network powerhouse for up to 10 years.* [source](https://https://medium.com/mxc/m2-pro-miner-faq-c6b4e8e60ab9)
 
 
## How is it possible to mine BTC with the M2 Pro?
BTC (Bitcoin) mining with the M2 Pro miner is currently in a testnet phase, with two public tests being completed already, and a third one planned for Q4 2021. The names that the MXC Foundation gave to these testnets are **Das Kaiser Projekt I, II, and III**.  The MXC Foundation provided some technical explanations, and average earnings, from these BTC mining testnets in several articles and videos, which can be found here:

[Das Kaiser Projekt I - article](https://medium.com/mxc/dkp-testnet-analysis-report-data-valuation-discrepancy-insight-596218b9a385)

[Das Kaiser Projekt II - article](https://medium.com/mxc/dkp-ii-testnet-critical-analysis-future-insights-390a6fa2183e)
