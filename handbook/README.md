# What is MXC?

MXC is a cryptocurrency token available for purchase and sale on several crypto exchanges worldwide; a list of some of these exchanges can be found at [coingecko.com](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/mxc#markets) and [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/mxc/markets/):

MXC is also a **global data network**, a network that is quickly spreading across the globe thanks to the very popular MXC miner (known as the [M2 Pro miner](https://matchx.io/pages/m2-pro-miner)) and the [MXC Supernodes](https://www.mxc.org/mxc-supernode) that have been deployed around the world. This global data network is designed to deliver data packets **more easily, across longer distances and faster than ever before**. Using LPWAN/LoRaWAN technology, the [MXC Foundation](https://mxc.org) and [MatchX](https://matchx.io) (the developer of the miner) are promoting this global data network via the MXProtocol and the M2 Pro crypto miner. 

MXC is a data token that is now literally covering the planet. Its growth can be seen in this link: [mxcmapper.com](https://mxcmapper.com/)

This MXC data network is also sometimes referred to as an **Internet of Things (IoT) network**, and in this case is designed **to help cities, companies, and individuals profit/benefit from building out an IoT network**.
